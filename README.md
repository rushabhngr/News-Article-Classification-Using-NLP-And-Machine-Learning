#  News Article Classification  

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying news articles into predefined categories such as **sports, politics, and technology**. With the rapid growth of digital content, efficient categorization helps organizations and platforms improve content management and provide personalized recommendations to users.  

By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, this project builds robust classification models to automatically tag articles based on their content.

##  Problem Statement  
The goal is to build a model that can:  
- Automatically classify news articles into categories like **sports, politics, and technology**.  
- Preprocess text data, extract features, and apply ML models for classification.  
- Evaluate and compare model performance to identify the most effective solution.

##  Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of **labeled news articles** across multiple categories.  
Each entry includes the article content and its associated category.

##  Deliverables  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and preprocess raw text (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.).  
   - Handle missing values and prepare text for feature extraction.  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Convert text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**, **Bag-of-Words**, or **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**.  
   - Perform **EDA** to explore category distribution.  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Train classifiers such as **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.  
   - Apply **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation**.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate using metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  
   - Compare model performance and choose the best.
